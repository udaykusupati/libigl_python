# libigl_python
Testing features from Libigl bound to python.

## Install environment

Run the following commands in your terminal to create and activate the conda environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate gcm_env
```

## Run jupyter notebook

Use jupyter notebook to use libigl, for some reason I had issues with jupyter lab.

```
jupyter notebook
